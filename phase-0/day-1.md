# ��� Cloud Learning Log — Phase 0

Welcome to the start of my cloud engineering journey! This is my **Phase 0**, where I’m exploring cloud concepts, experimenting with tools, and setting the foundation for hands-on learning. My goal is to document my progress, reflect on challenges, and stay consistent.

---

## ��� My Learning Goals

For Phase 0, my focus is to:

1. **Understand cloud engineering roles**  
   Gain clarity on the differences between Cloud Engineer, DevOps Engineer, SRE, and Cloud Security Engineer.

2. **Explore major cloud providers**  
   Familiarize myself with AWS, GCP, and Azure to understand their strengths, services, and real-world use cases.

3. **Develop a terminal first mindet**  
   Rely on CLI tools, scripting, and official documentation instead of over-relying on tutorials.

4. **Track my learning journey publicly**  
   Maintain a GitHub learning log to reflect on growth, record lessons learned, and showcase small projects along the way.

## ☁️ Cloud Roles of Interest

Here’s a list of the roles I’m most curious about:

- **Cloud Engineer:** They focus on designing, building, and maintaining cloud infrastructure. They are the architects and builders of the cloud.  
- **DevOps Engineer:** They automate deployment, manages CI/CD pipelines, and ensures systems are reliable and scalable.  
- **SRE (Site Reliability Engineer):** They ensures that applications run smoothly, monitors performance, and scales systems efficiently.  
- **Cloud Security Engineer:** They protect cloud environments, sets up compliance controls, and ensures secure operations across services.

> Each role is unique and interesting, and I’m excited to explore which areas I will gravitate toward as I gain hands-on experience.

## ��� List of Cloud Providers

- **AWS (Amazon Web Services):** The market leader with the widest range of services. Great for learning cloud fundamentals and real-world applications.  
- **GCP (Google Cloud Platform):** Known for strong data and AI/ML capabilities. Great for analytics focused projects.  
- **Azure:** Popular in enterprise and hybrid environments. Great for learning how large organizations adopt cloud.

> My plan is to focus first on AWS for hands-on practice while exploring GCP and Azure conceptually.

## ��� My Learning Approach

- **Applied Skills First:** Hands-on practice is my priority.  
- **Terminal-First Mindset:** I aim to use CLI tools, scripting, and Infrastructure as Code to interact with cloud services rather than relying solely on web consoles.  
- **Consistent Documentation:** Every day/week, I’ll update my learning log with notes, screenshots, and reflections to track progress and build a portfolio.

> I think documenting my journey will help solidify what i have learnt, track mistakes, and celebrate small wins along the way. It will also makes it easier to revisit lessons and share insights with others.

*End of Phase 0 setup,  ready for phase 1 where i will begin to dive into hands-on cloud experiments!*
